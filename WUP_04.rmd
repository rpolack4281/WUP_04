# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data is in the file GSScsv.csv and came from the 2018 General Social Survey.  The question to answer is to resolve this hypothesis.  
$H_0$ There is no difference between the average score on the WORDSUM test and level of schooling DEGREE  
$H_a$ There is a significant difference in average score on the WORDSUM test between at least two levels of DEGREE  

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(mydata,aes(x=DEGREE,y=WORDSUM))
```
```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```

It appears that the people with a graduate level degree have a higher score than other degrees as the median is about as high as the Q3 of both bachelor's and junior college degrees. The Lt high school seems to be at the lowest as the median is lower than the high school level by a unit or so.


### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->


```{r}
favstats(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=mydata)
```

The order of the mean is from graduate, then junior college, then bachelors, then Lt high school, and finally high school. Notice that the junior college only has a population of 12 while the bachelors has 44. The high school has the largest popluation at 85. 

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
model1 <- aov(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=mydata)
summary.aov(model1)
```

The P value is 0.000236 and is small enough to show that there is no similarity in categories of data.

```{r}
#we specify the margins starting at the bottom and proceeding clockwise - thus 8.7 is the left side margin to hold the names of the factors
par(mar = c(3, 15.7, 2, 2))
plot(TukeyHSD(model1),las=2)
```

According to these confidence intervals the data of the high school and graduate degrees are significantly different, as well as Lt high school and graduate degrees are significantly different.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->

Based on the box plots, the numerical data including the mean, as well as the inferential results, we can say that by the time that a person receives a graduate degree, their word sum test will be greater than when they were in Lt and regular high school.
